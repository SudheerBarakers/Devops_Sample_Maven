# SampleBuildProject


Creating a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline with parallel execution involves setting up a workflow where 
multiple tasks or stages can run concurrently to speed up the overall build and deployment process. Below is a basic example of a 
Jenkins pipeline using the Declarative Pipeline syntax with parallel stages. This example assumes a simple Java Maven project.

1.	Jenkins Configuration: Ensure you have Jenkins installed and configured. Also, make sure you have the
        necessary plugins installed, such as the Pipeline plugin.
  	
2.      Pipeline Script: Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins and use the following pipeline script.
        This script defines parallel stages for building and testing in parallel.
    
3.	Configure Jenkins Pipeline: In your Jenkins job configuration, select "Pipeline script" as the Definition, and paste the script into the Script box.
4.	Save and Run: Save the pipeline configuration, and then run the pipeline. Jenkins will execute the stages in parallel,
        improving the overall pipeline execution time.
5.	Customization:
  	  - Customize the stages and steps according to your project's requirements.
	  - Add additional stages for static code analysis, code scanning, and other tasks.
	  - Integrate deployment steps as needed.

This script includes three stages: "Build and Test," "Deploy," and "Checkout." The "Build and Test" stage has three parallel sub-stages for building the application, running unit tests, and running integration tests.
